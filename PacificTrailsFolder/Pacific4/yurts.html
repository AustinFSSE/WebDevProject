                    Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, a roof dome that can be opened, and a private deck.

                <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather
                    with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</dd>
